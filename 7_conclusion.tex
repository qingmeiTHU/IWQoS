\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
In the future, we would first implement and test individual design methods in Section~\ref{sec:design-space}, including adaptive GOP selection and online frame drop strategy. In our expectation, the final solution would be a combination of these design methods. For example, increase queue threshold, selectively drop frames if the threshold is reached, and when the network recovers, pick a recent frame, recompute the GOP, and send the timely frames to the network.
