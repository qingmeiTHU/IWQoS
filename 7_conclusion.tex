\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
We proposed GVBR, a combined algorithm which improves the default frame dropping strategy and design an effective video adaptation algorithm. The revised frame dropping strategy considers the case that two or more GoPs exists in the buffer and keeps the frames of the next GoP, thus has a tiny gap between oracle, 5\%. GVBR chooses the bitrate according to the difference between the estimated bandwidth and the data size in buffer, the difference reflects much more accurately the real available bandwidth. Massive experiments illustrates that GVBR reduces 50\% of frame dropping compared with the state-of-art adaptation methods. All in all, our proposed combined algorithm, GVBR, reduces the paly failure time from 26s to 1s, improves more than 96\%.
As future work, we would implement GVBR algorithm in practical.
